I run http://gw2tp.com/ and a few people have been asking me how I manage to scrape the trading post and gem exchange, so here's the script I use to do it.

**PLEASE NOTE:** In order to use this script you need to extract a valid session key from the game, I use [Fiddler2](http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/) to get this key, enable its HTTPS mode and open the Gem Exchange or Trading Post in-game, you should see the session key in the URL. Also note that the keys occaisionally expire and you'll have to do get a new one.
